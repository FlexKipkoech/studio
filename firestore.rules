/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model and ensures
 * only active users can interact with data. A user's profile information is
 * private to them, and all data access requires the user to be authenticated and
 * have an `isActive` flag set to `true` in their own user document.
 *
 * Data Structure: All user-specific data is stored in a top-level `users`
 * collection. The document ID for each user's profile MUST match their Firebase
 * Authentication UID. The structure is `/users/{userId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Active User Check: The most critical rule. The `isUserActive()` function
 *   is called in almost every rule to ensure that only users with `isActive == true`
 *   can perform any operation. This is a global guard against unauthorized access
 *   from deactivated accounts.
 * - User Privacy: Users can only access their own profile document. They cannot
 *   read other users' data.
 * - No User Listing: Listing the entire `/users` collection is explicitly
 *   disallowed to prevent scraping of user information.
 * - Role Immutability: A user cannot change their own `role` or `isActive` status.
 *   These are considered admin-controlled fields.
 * - Relational Integrity: The `id` field within a user document is required on
 *   creation to match the document's ID (`userId`), and it cannot be changed on
 *   update.
