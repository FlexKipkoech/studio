/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user
 * has a dedicated document for their profile information, and they are the only
 * person who can read or write to it. This provides a strong security foundation
 * by isolating user data.
 *
 * Data Structure: All user-specific data is stored in a top-level `users`
 * collection. The document ID for each user's profile MUST match their Firebase
 * Authentication UID. The structure is `/users/{userId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Privacy: Users can only access their own profile document. They cannot
 *   read other users' data.
 * - No User Listing: Listing the entire `/users` collection is explicitly
 *   disallowed to prevent scraping of user information.
 * - Role Immutability: A user cannot change their own `role` or `isActive` status.
 *   These are considered admin-controlled fields, and allowing users to modify them
 *   would create a major security vulnerability (e.g., self-promotion to 'Admin').
 * - Relational Integrity: The `id` field within a user document is required on
 *   creation to match the document's ID (`userId`), and it cannot be changed on
 *   update. This ensures the data remains consistent with its path.
