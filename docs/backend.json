User data is stored under `/users/{userId}` ensuring path-based ownership, which simplifies security rules. This structure avoids using `get()` calls in security rules, enabling atomic operations (transactions/batches) and improving debuggability by denormalizing the role to the `users` document. This structure uses segregation by using the path-based ownership approach which makes the structure more secure and easier to debug."
